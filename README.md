# RECCO Project Dashboard

## Overview

This project provides a dashboard to monitor and optimize the **Yield Prediction**, **Supply and Demand Forecasting**, and **Revenue Sharing and Payment Optimization** for the RECCO project. The dashboard is built using **Apache Superset** for interactive data visualization, enabling users to explore key metrics, trends, and insights for the RECCO use cases.

The three primary use cases covered are:

1. **Yield Prediction**: Predict and monitor the yield percentage of material extraction across different vendors, batches, and processing methods.
2. **Supply and Demand Forecasting**: Forecast supply and demand trends for materials, vendors, and stockroom quantities over time.
3. **Revenue Sharing and Payment Optimization**: Optimize the revenue sharing process and visualize payment distribution based on vendor performance and quality.

## Repository Structure

The project follows a structured repository layout to ensure modularity and ease of development for both frontend and backend functionalities, along with dashboards, models, and documentation.

- **Metrics**: Weight (tons), Final Payment, Stockroom Quantity.
- **Filters**: Vendor, Material, Stockroom.
- **Charts**: Area Chart showing cumulative supply and demand over time.

### Use Case 3: Revenue Sharing and Payment Optimization
- **Goal**: Optimize and visualize the distribution of **revenue and payments** across vendors based on performance and efficiency.
- **Metrics**: Final Payment, Processing Efficiency (%), Yield (%).
- **Filters**: Vendor, Batch ID, Processing Method.
- **Charts**: Bar Chart showing revenue distribution across vendors.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. **Apache Superset**: Install and configure Apache Superset to visualize the data.
3. **Database**: Load your data into a compatible database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) that Apache Superset can connect to.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recco-dashboard.git
   cd recco-dashboard
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start Apache Superset and connect to the database:

   Follow the [Apache Superset Installation Guide](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset) to install and run Superset. Once running, connect Superset to your database containing the RECCO data.

4. Load the **datasets** into Superset:

   - Create a new dataset for each use case (Yield Prediction, Supply and Demand Forecasting, and Revenue Sharing).
   - Use the data files in the `data/` folder or connect directly to the database.

5. Configure the **charts** for each use case:

   - Go to the **Charts** section in Superset and create charts for each use case using the configurations stored in the `dashboard/charts/` folder.

6. Build the **dashboard**:

   - Add the created charts into a dashboard.
   - Customize the layout, filters, and interactive elements to make the dashboard more dynamic.

## Apache Superset Dashboard and Charts

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore the three use cases for RECCO: **Yield Prediction**, **Supply and Demand Forecasting**, and **Revenue Sharing and Payment Optimization**. Users can filter data, explore trends, and make data-driven decisions using Apache Superset's powerful charting capabilities.

### Dashboard Structure

The dashboard consists of three primary sections, each corresponding to one of the use cases:

#### **1. Yield Prediction Charts**
- **Line Chart**: Displays the **Yield (%)** over time, with options to filter by **Vendor**, **Batch ID**, and **Processing Method**.
- **Filters**: Users can filter the chart by vendors, batches, and time periods to compare the yield for different entities.
- **Metrics**: The key metric is **Yield (%)**, and you can also plot additional metrics such as **Aluminum (%)**, **Heavy Metals (%)**, and **Processing Efficiency (%)**.

#### **2. Supply and Demand Forecasting Charts**
- **Area Chart**: Shows cumulative **Weight (tons)** and **Final Payment** over time, allowing users to visualize the trends in supply and demand.
- **Filters**: Users can filter by **Vendor**, **Material**, and **Stockroom** to focus on specific aspects of supply or demand.
- **Metrics**: The key metrics here are **Weight (tons)** for supply and **Final Payment** for demand, with additional insights into stock levels and vendor contributions.

#### **3. Revenue Sharing and Payment Optimization Charts**
- **Bar Chart**: Compares the **Final Payment** across different vendors, showing how revenue is distributed based on performance.
- **Filters**: Filters for **Vendor**, **Batch ID**, and **Processing Method** allow users to focus on specific vendors or methods to optimize revenue sharing.
- **Metrics**: Key metrics include **Final Payment**, **Processing Efficiency (%)**, and **Yield (%)**.

### Customization in Apache Superset

Each chart and dashboard can be customized with the following options:

- **X-Axis**: For time-series charts, the `Date` column is used on the X-axis. For other charts, the `Vendor` or `Batch ID` may be used.
- **Metrics**: Metrics such as `Yield (%)`, `Aluminum (%)`, `Weight (tons)`, and `Final Payment` can be added and configured.
- **Filters**: Interactive filters like `Vendor`, `Batch ID`, `Date`, and `Processing Method` are provided to explore data dynamically.
- **Annotations**: Annotations and trend lines can be added to highlight key events or predict future trends.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Superset's predictive analytics can be applied to certain charts to forecast trends based on historical data.

## Usage

### Running the Dashboard

Once the setup is complete, you can access the dashboard via Apache Superset:

1. Navigate to the **Dashboards** tab in Superset.
2. Open the **RECCO Project Dashboard** to view the charts for the three use cases.
3. Use the **filters** to explore specific vendors, batches, materials, or time periods.

### Analyzing the Use Cases

- **Yield Prediction**: View trends in yield over time, filter by vendor or batch to compare performance, and analyze the impact of material composition.
- **Supply and Demand Forecasting**: Analyze the balance of supply and demand, track material availability, and forecast future demand.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Evaluate the distribution of revenue and payments based on vendor performance, efficiency, and material quality.

## Example Data

Example datasets used for each use case can be found in the `data/` folder. These include:

- `yield_prediction_data.csv`: Data for predicting material yield.
- `supply_demand_data.csv`: Data for tracking material supply and demand.
- `revenue_sharing_data.csv`: Data for analyzing revenue and payment distribution.
